I am a software engineer and earned my Ph.D. in computer science.

As a software engineer, I am particularly fond of agile development methodologies. I have no preference towards any approach. Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of any of them, bring them all on; especially if there are graphs and metrics showing progress. For me, there is just something about seeing graphs that reflect the progress of a project. I'm a firm believer of test cases, however, I'm not particularly into Test Driven Development (TDD) because TDD is hard to apply when requirements are not been fully specified. So, I adopt the reverse process of TDD: write the code and then write the test cases to cover every path. In addition, this approach works particularly well with continuous integration and deployment, which I'm also a fan.

In my spare time, I enjoy keeping up with all things technology-related. Sustainable and renewable power is one of my favorites. Harvesting power from the sun, wind, water, and whatever else we can concoct, is truly amazing. Anything that can reduce our dependency on the grid is welcomed.

Another of my favorites is home automation with the motto of "automate everything". What is the point of automating everything if I have to deal with all the various automated systems. This leads me to another of my favorites: Internet of Things (IoT). If all the automated systems are interconnected, I would have a much easier time controlling them. Imagine this scenario, the wake-up alarm goes off in your clock, the coffee maker knows that it is time to wake up and begins brewing your favorite coffee. Or your front door sensors detected that you are the last person to exit the house, then the lights can be shut off, the AC/heater can be turned off or set to a power-saving mode.

Ahh, the wonders of technology. But remember that:

> Technology is a double-edged sword. It can be used for good **and** bad.
